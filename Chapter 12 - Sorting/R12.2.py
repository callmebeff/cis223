"""
In the merge-sort tree shown in Figures 12.2 through 12.4, some edges are
drawn as arrows. What is the meaning of a downward arrow? How about
an upward arrow?
"""

"""
A downward arrow indicates the split of the initial sequence. There are always two down
arrows, for each split of each sequence. 

The up arrows indicate that values are being returned to the sequence those values 
derived from, in sorted order, returning all the way up to the initial sequence.
